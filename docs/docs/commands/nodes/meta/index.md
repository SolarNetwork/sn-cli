# Nodes Meta Commands

The `nodes meta` commands deal with [SolarNode metadata][node-metadata], which is
[metadata][metadata] associated with a specific node. Node metadata is both published and consumed
by nodes. For example nodes publish metadata about themselves (like hardware architecture and
version); node metadata can be easily used in [node expressions][node-metadata-expr], which
makes it a good candidate for node-level parameters that do not change too frequently.
